jquery.sameheight.js
====================

Very simple jQuery plugin to keep page elements the same height. Call it like
you would any jQuery plugin:

    $('.selection').sameHeight();

Selected items are set to the same height when it is called, and the height
will be adjusted as `$(window)` is resized.
